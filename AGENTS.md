# Root AGENTS.md

`Takt` is a time tracking tool.

## Implementation rules

Plans typically have acceptance criteria with check boxes. Check each box when you are finished with the corresponding criterion.

## General Rules for the Code Base

TBD

### Code Style

For the project's code style, refer to `CODESTYLE.md`.

## Local Development Commands

Run these from the repository root. The scripts and the coverage recipe use the local tools from
`dotnet-tools.json`, so run `dotnet tool restore` once after cloning.

| Purpose                         | Command                                                              |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Apply the code style            | `./cleanup_code.sh`                                                  |
| Find code issues                | `./inspect_code.sh`                                                  |
| Find code issues in a branch    | `./inspect_code.sh --base <revision>`                                |
| Complete test suite             | `dotnet test Takt.slnx`                                              |
| Release parity                  | `dotnet build -c Release Takt.slnx`                            |

### Code style and inspections

Run `./cleanup_code.sh` when you are finished with a change. It applies ReSharper's `Zorn` profile to the files Git reports as changed, staged, or untracked.

`./inspect_code.sh` runs ReSharper's inspections and reports semantic findings. Only C# files are inspected, because `inspectcode` has no rules for the other file types `cleanup_code.sh` formats. Every argument the script does not own itself is forwarded to `dotnet jb inspectcode`, so `-e=WARNING` narrows the report to warnings and above. Both scripts print `No matching files to process.` and do nothing when no file of a relevant type is affected.

Match the scope to what you are checking:

- **No arguments** — the changed, staged, and untracked files, like `cleanup_code.sh`. Use this while implementing, after `cleanup_code.sh` and before committing.
- **`--base <revision>`** — the C# files added, modified, or renamed in `<revision>...HEAD`, plus the current working-tree changes. Use this to review a committed branch or stack layer, with the trunk or the layer below as the base. `--base=<revision>` works as well.
- **`--all`** — the whole solution. Reserve this for explicit whole-solution audits, analyzer or configuration changes, and broad refactors. It is slow and reports pre-existing findings that have nothing to do with the change under review.

`--base` and `--all` are mutually exclusive. A scoped run that selects no C# files means the inspection is not applicable to that change; it is not a reason to fall back to `--all`.

Findings are advisory: the script reports them and exits 0 either way. A non-zero exit means the inspection itself could not run, for example because an argument was invalid, or because the `--base` revision could not be resolved or shares no history with `HEAD`, as in a shallow clone.

**Formatting is `cleanup_code.sh`'s responsibility.** `inspect_code.sh` does not report formatting deviations, because `inspectcode` ships nearly all of its formatting rules disabled and enabling them would mean changing the shared `Takt.slnx.DotSettings` for everyone working in the solution. Do not reach for the inspection script expecting whitespace, indentation, or brace findings.

Do not use `dotnet format`: it never reads `Takt.slnx.DotSettings` and therefore reports findings that contradict the profile this repository actually enforces.
